*Unimacro* provides extended and advanced command grammars for *Dragon* NaturallySpeaking.

Unimacro connects to the [NatLink]/[NatPython] project, which again connects to [Dragon NaturallySpeaking].

So Unimacro is an extension of an extension of the speech recognition program Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

Unimacro is free, like NatLink/NatPython, and can be downloaded from SourceForge.

Unimacro also aims at unifying the different open source developments that use Natlink as basis. Therefore on this website
the combined link(/installation/installation.html, installer for NatLink/Unimacro/
Vocola 2) is also presented.

 Positioning of Unimacro
 
-link(http://www.nuance.com, *Dragon NaturallySpeaking*) is a general speech recognition program, sold by Nuance.
-*NatLink/NatPython* is an open source project written by Joel Gould.  His general link(http://www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/pythonamacroasystem.htm, *introduction and explanation*) is several years old, but still very instructive.
Read for example the general presentation about
link(www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/NatLinkTalk.ppt, *NatLink (basics)*). For a more thorough discussion, read the *link(implementation_and_acceptance_of_natlink.pdf)* written by Joel Gould probably in 2001.
-Meant as a unifying set of *grammars* the *Unimacro* project was started.  The grammars that are presented on this website all run inside NatLink/NatPython.  In other words: they are in the NatLink system.

-link(http://vocola.net/default.asp, *Vocola 2*) is another development running in the NatLink system. See pages on  link(/features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, *Vocola 2 and Unimacro*), which to use when. Also see link(http://vocola.net/v2/, the Vocola 2 website). Vocola 2 can use link(/features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, Unimacro features). (Note for Windows Speech Recognition use can try Vocola 3.)
:xx:
-link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode, *VoiceCode*) is the third big application based on NatLink.
:en:
-link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode/, *VoiceCode*) is the third big application based on NatLink.
Read the link(www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/VoiceCoders.ppt, *VoiceCode (initial advice)*) presentation of Joel Gould, which he gave before the voicecode project started. Regrettably this project is not maintained in the last few years, so the status of it is unclear at the moment.

-As another application based on NatLink, link(https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly/, *Dragonfly*) has been developed in a more modern way. It is very powerful, and integration with Unimacro and Vocola 2 will be investigated. Dragonfly also works with Windows Speech Recognition!


 What is on this site?

-The link(/installation/installation.html, *installation/configuration section*)
will guide you through the installation details of NatLink/Vocola 2 and Unimacro.
-The link(features/index.html, *features section*) explains the powerful things that are implemented with Unimacro. 
-A comparison between link(features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, *Unimacro and Vocola*), they coexist and cooperate on many aspects.
-The link(/grammars/index.html, *grammars section*) is by far the most important for practical use.  Most of the grammars are designed to be global, so first look into the global grammars examples. 
-More technical details of the different link(features/grammarclasses/index.html, *Unimacro grammar classes*) and link(installation/technicaldetails/index.html, *NatLink in general*).
-Finally, link(aboutunimacro, *About Unimacro*) gives information on the authors of this project and the copyright notice, and asks you for a donation.


 Demo movies
 
Some  demonstration movies have been made, to show features of Unimacro.

-From some time ago:
--link(grammars/globalgrammars/folders/index.html, grammar folders, opening folders, files and drives)
--link(grammars/globalgrammars/tasks/index.html, several demo movies on task switching, both Dutch and English)
--link(grammars/games/patience.html, Dutch: playing solitaire)
--link(features/cooperationwithvoicecoder/index.html, interaction Unimacro with voicecoder)

The last beta, nearly stable, release: *4.1tango* (July 24, 2017)
