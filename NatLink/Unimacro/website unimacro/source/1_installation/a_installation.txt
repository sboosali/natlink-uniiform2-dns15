-*Download link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlinktest4.1/setup-natlink-4.1tango.exe/download, release 4.1tango)*.
 -Some changes in the configure program. The checking/confirming that that the natlink.pyd (dll) is did not work, so we should trust this works correct. In the past there were occasional problems with this.

-Improving the coupling between Vocola and Unimacro when Unimacro is not enabled
-Pre-final release.

-Hints for fixing the msvcr100.dll problem and for failure of the installation of the Windows (win32) extensions of Python.
-NatLink does not (yet) work with Dragon 15.
-Chrome_browsing.py grammar, using the "Click by Voice" extension written by Mark Lillibridge.

- Minor test release
-- checking the correct Dragon and Windows version
-- testing Vocola changes

 Previous (4.1oscar) is also still available:
- NatLink installer

--Lots of changes in an effort to make things more intuitive and more stable
--Now Unimacro is enabled/disabled by specifying/clearing of the UnimacroUserDirectory.
--A separate UserDirectory for user grammars or eg Dragonfly is now supported.

- Vocola release 2.8.2
-- Extra checks for missing modules in start_configurenatlink.py

- Unimacro
-- Several grammars, will be elaborated ASAP.

 Other recent changes:

- Unimacro folders grammar: link(/grammars/globalgrammars/folders/trackfoldershistory.html, recent folders option) and link(/grammars/globalgrammars/folders/details.html, support for xplorer2).
- Now recognises also Dragon 13
- Adapted playString function (SendInput by Mark Lillibridge) via natlinkutils.playString
- natlinkmain.py has nearly all code caught in a try except statement

 And also:
-There is some backward compatibility broken, see page about link(/installation/technicaldetails/natlinkutils.html, *natlinkutils*).
-Unimacro has new features: link(/features/autohotkey/index.html, *AutHotkey support*) (also usable with Vocola) and
link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, *action classes for applications*).
-The grammar link(/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/index.html, _lines) has in some application now the *line numbers modulo hundred* possibility.
-Works with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7
-NatLink for Dragon 12 does NOT work in Python 2.5 any more.
-The installation of Python 2.5 in Windows 8 probably has complications, so please take Python 2.6 or Python 2.7.
-Test results are still welcome.
-link(/aboutunimacro/donation/index.html, *Donations*) are very welcome.
-Have a look at some demo video's:

 For Dragon 11 and before: either install link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlink4.0/setup-natlink-4.0.exe/download, Release 4.0), but you are probably better off with this beta release.

-So please try this *4.1papa* release.
-Some improvements in configure program
-Stable with most things of Dragon 11.
-Works with Python2.5 and Python2.6 (recommended).


-The files are in the link("http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files", "*NatLink repository*"). Click on the different "buttons" in case the links below do not work.

   Installing Python2.7.12
-Download link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.7.12.exe/download, *Python Needed for NatLink 2.7*).  This is a self-extracting zip file, with extension .exe. December 2016 2.7.12 is the latest 2.7 release.
-Run the self-extracting executable to unzip the installers to a temporary folder.
-Install *Python* (for all users, which is the default)
-Install the three other packages, the *windows extensions (pywin32)*, *wxPython* and (only needed for VoiceCode) *PyXML*.
-*Warning*: NatLink does not work when you install a "64 bit" python version.

 
   Installing Python2.6 
-Download link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.6.zip/download, *Python Needed for NatLink 2.6*).  This is a self-extracting zip file. 
-Run the self-extracting executable to unzip the installers to a temporary folder and install the different items, starting with python-2.6.4.msi.
-*Warning*: NatLink does not work when you install a "64 bit" python version.


   Download and install NatLink/Vocola 2/Unimacro

-Download the combined installer as given above.
-Run the downloaded file.
-Install on *C:\NatLink* (or *D:\NatLink* or any other drive of your choice). Installing in "C:\Program files\NatLink" is *NOT* advised any more.

 Directory layout after installation
 
When you installed at *C:\NatLink* you will get the following directory structure:
-NatLink and Vocola 2 are in *C:\NatLink\NatLink*,
-Unimacro is in *C:\NatLink\Unimacro*
-User defined grammars can be in any location, for example *C:\UserDirectory* or *C:\NatLink\NatlinkUserDirectory*. You can also choose Dragonfly for this directory.
-The core directory is *C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core* (the "controlling" NatLink files are located here)
-Internally the compiled Vocola 2 files will go in *C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem* (this is the baseDirectory of NatLink. Do not put anything else in these directory).
-In case you cannot find your configuration program (the GUI): it is located in *C:\NatLink\NatLink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro*. The configuration (GUI) program is the file "configurenatlink.pyw". In order to run elevated mode, you should start the script "start_configurenatlink.py" in the same directory.
-Elevated mode is only needed the first time you run the configure program, and when you want to enable/disable NatLink or when you want to unregister or (re)register *natlink.pyd*.
