Problems with installation?


 When starting Dragon after configuration several things can go wrong:
 
-Dragon gives message: *Cannot load compatibility module support (GUID = {dd990001-bb89-1d2-b031-0060088dc929}))*.
-This can also happen when you start the Congifure GUI program. It is this message:

 1. Possibly registering natlink.pyd failed.

If you want to register natlink.pyd manually, you should take 3 steps.

Goto the Core directory of NatLink (eg. C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core). This directory holds a subdirectory PYD.
=Copy the correct file from the PYD subdirectory into the core directory, and rename the file to natlink.pyd. 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 referring to the python version you use, and ANSI for Dragon up to version 11, UNICODE for Dragon 12 and above.
=


This is the "dll" file with which NatLink communicates with Dragon.

You can register this file to windows manually after you close Dragon. See the short video:

 2. Maybe there is something wrong with the dll file *msvcr100.dll*

Try to solve this by:
--goto the natlink core directory (eg C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core) and then
--goto the subdirectory msvcr100fix.
--copy the dll file msvcr100.dll into the core directory or into the C:\Windows\System32 directory. For the latter choice you need to confirm the action.

-Restart Dragon. Hopefully it works.

-This happens sometimes, and so is difficult to reproduce. It happened on an older 32bits computer with Windows 7 and NatSpeak 10 installed. Above instructions worked. Other experiences are welcome. They are also in the README.txt file in above mentioned directory.

 "No valid DNS INI files Dir found"
-These should automatically found by the configure program. If not, they can be specified in the info panel of the configure GUI, or with the "c" option in the natlinkconfigfunctions.py program. Should not happen in recent versions of Dragon though.
-The most probable path is *C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking12* (Dragon 12)
-This should be fixed with version 4.1quebec.

 Most grammar files do not start.
 
You see this in the Messages window like:

image(errors windows extensions not correct installed.jpg, title="natlink problem, windows extensions of python not correct installed",  displayscale=0.5)

A possible fix is running the script start_postinstallscript_pywin32.cmd in admin mode. You can find this file in the directory ...\natlink\natlink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro. Right click on the file and Run as Administator.

 Actions.ini

-The file actions.ini cannot be found anywhere. See link(ini file strategy.html, the next page: Ini file strategy).

 Changed python version
If you changed your python version, *eg from 2.5 to 2.7* running the Config program should note this and do the necessary changes.
-Take the Basic actions above, and check your python version in the info panel of the configure program.

 Configuration GUI or Configuration CLI do not run

-It can happen that the python shortcut has been changed. You can either:
--Open start_configurenatlink.py or start_natlinkconfigfunctions.py in IDLE and run from there
--Assign *python.exe* to the *start_configurenatlink.py* file (or any *.py* python file) by right clicking on the file (in an explorer window), and choose Open with, Choose default program, and then choose python.exe.

-A lot of effort  has been put in working away  at us and catching them properly.   If this still  prevents the configure program  from running, please report.

 If nothing else works
You can manually disable NatLink by changing the file *nsapps.ini*. See page link(problemswithnatlink.html, problems with NatLink), near the bottom.
